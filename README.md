# docmac

Wrapper around docker, boot2docker and Virtual Box, that makes installing and running docker on a Mac a breeze.

## Status

**Alpha**, `bin` files work, so to install and launch docker you can do:

```sh
bin/install.sh
bin/up.sh
```

You can then play with one of the examples.

## Resources

Most of the bin scripts have been adapted from these [installation
instructions](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/mac/)
